Write an app using react

Login page on the root page of the project. Write “Hello {users_email} after user logged in. Index page should be restricted to un-authorized users.

Create a page with text “Hello {username}”, where {username} is real username of a user. This page should be protected and can’t be seen to non-authorized users. You can use any database for testing purpose. We’re interested to see how you will implement such feature.

For authentication you should use JWT tokens. You can search and install any JWT app to use it as a back end.

Remember me feature(refresh token) will be a plus.
